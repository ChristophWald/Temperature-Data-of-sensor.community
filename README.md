This is a study project where I tested the quality of the temperature data of the [sensor.community](https://sensor.community/de/) project, a citizen science project. As the projects inital aim was to gather data about air pollution, the sensors aren't made for reliable temperature measurements and are also set up at places with different sun exposure. Results show that regions with enough sensors show the expected regular cycles, but for tendencies over longer timespans the data is too scarce.

**next step**: The data could be compared to official and controlled measurements to classify deviations.

The dataset used is about 3GB is available on request.
